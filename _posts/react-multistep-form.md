# Introduction

Forms are primary components available almost on any website. 
We are using them to collect information from users. 
Starting from a simple contact form to a complex multistep order form.
Managing multistep forms can be cumbersome, especially when we add custom validation. 

In this article I would like to share my solution to handle complex multistep forms.
I will use [React](https://github.com/facebook/react), [Formik](https://github.com/formium/formik) as form library, and [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) as validation library.
